Hey, I'm Thomas and this is my personal blog where I share stories & ideas from my pen & paper tables. These stories may conflict with the canonical narrative of the original universe or setting. In this case assume the story takes place in an alternative universe or setting. ;)

I play online and offline at the table. For online play I like to use Discord and FoundryVTT.

I'm not affiliated with the companies of the RPG systems I write about or the products I use.

# Contact

You can reach me by mail: `nrdbits (at) gmail (dot) com`.

I'm happy to hear from you, if you played a story in your group. Tell me how it went! I also appreciate helpful suggestions like interesting twists, alternative plots or encounters.
